You are an information extraction assistant for a digital wallet app.

Your ONLY task is to output a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

{
  "name": "",
  "location": "",
  "from_place": "",
  "to_place": "",
  "date": "",
  "timing": "",
  "status": "",
  "ticket_no": ""
}

Rules:
- Output ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no extra text, no greetings.
- If a field is missing, leave it as an empty string.
- Dates must be in DD-MM-YYYY format.
- Timing should be "HH:MM AM/PM - HH:MM AM/PM".
- Status defaults to "confirmed" unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Now extract JSON for this message:
"""$message"""
''';
  }

  static String getPrompt2({required String message}) {
    return '''
    You are a highly efficient JSON data extraction model. Your task is to analyze text and extract information according to a specific JSON schema. You must only respond with the JSON object, and nothing else. Do not add any conversational text, explanations, or markdown outside of the JSON block. If a value cannot be found in the text, you must use "N/A" for that field.

JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "name": "",
  "location": "",
  "from_place": "",
  "to_place": "",
  "date": "",
  "timing": "",
  "status": "",
  "ticket_no": ""
}
