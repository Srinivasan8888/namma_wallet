# **Privacy Policy – Namma Wallet**

**Last Updated: [22-11-2025]**

Namma Wallet (“we”, “our”, “the app”) is an open-source Flutter application built by the Flutter Chennai Community. The app helps users automatically create tickets or events by processing SMS and notifications using an **on-device Large Language Model (LLM)**.
We care about your privacy and are committed to transparency in how the app works and what data it handles.

---

## **1. Data Collection and Use**

### **1.1 SMS Data**

* The app reads selected SMS messages for the sole purpose of extracting relevant information to create tickets or events.
* SMS content is processed **entirely on your device** using an **offline LLM**.
* **No SMS data is transmitted, stored on external servers, or shared with anyone.**

### **1.2 Notification Data**

* The app accesses specific app notifications if permission is granted.
* The purpose is to detect relevant notifications (e.g., ticket updates, transactions, travel confirmations) and create events.
* Notification data is **never uploaded** or shared outside the device.

### **1.3 Camera Access**

* Camera permission is used only for features like scanning (QR codes, receipts, etc.) depending on the app features.
* No images or video data leave your device.

### **1.4 Internet Access**

* The app uses the internet **only once** to download the required LLM model.
* After the model is downloaded, **all processing happens offline**.
* The app does **not** send personal data over the internet.

---

## **2. No Data Leaves Your Device**

* All SMS, notification, and generated ticket/event data remains on your device.
* All text processing is performed using an **on-device AI model**.
* The app does **not** use cloud servers, external APIs, analytics, tracking, or remote processing.
* We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
